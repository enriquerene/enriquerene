# Interests
My passion lies in working with data and mathematical manipulation.
I have a particular favoritism for C++ and Python programming languages and am currently focusing my studies on machine learning and data analysis.
I'm particularly drawn to Data Engineer positions or Full Stack Development roles with a data-centric approach and excited about the prospect of taking on new challenges and expanding my skillset in such positions.
