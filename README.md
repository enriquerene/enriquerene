# Who I am
My name is Enrique René (@enriquerene). I'm from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, LATAM Software Engineer.
I'm experienced FullStack Engineer in RESTful Systems and hybrid mobile applications.
I bring a deep knowledge of various technologies such as PHP, ReactJS, Python, C++, SQL, Linux, AWS and Docker.
Very comfortable with BDD, TDD, SEO, Agile methodologies, pair programming, meetings with international clients and managers, CI/CD, Clean Code, mathematical and statistical analysis.

I’m a collaborative Problem Solver focused on team’s goals, always willing to share and learn from others.
Challenges excite me, and I am always seeking new opportunities to learn and grow both personally and professionally.
I also have experience teaching and mentoring small teams respecting individualities.

# Interests
My passion lies in working with data and mathematical manipulation.
I have a particular favoritism for C++ and Python programming languages and am currently focusing my studies on machine learning and data analysis.
I'm particularly drawn to Data Engineer positions or Full Stack Development roles with a data-centric approach and excited about the prospect of taking on new challenges and expanding my skillset in such positions.
