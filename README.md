My 10+ years journey as a freelancer and in a software house has shaped me into a collaborative problem solver who’s always ready to take on new challenges and grow. I'm fluent in English, Spanish, and Portuguese, and excel at translating client needs into technical solutions.

# Professional Journey
As a FullStack Engineer, my core expertise lies in RESTful Systems and hybrid mobile applications. I have a strong foundation in the LAMP stack, which has been the cornerstone of my development work. However, my professional focus has shifted towards the Node.js ecosystem, driven by my passion for JavaScript technologies.

I am currently planning to achieve the AWS Solutions Architect certification, reflecting my proficiency and commitment to cloud technologies. Additionally, enhancing my project management and team leadership skills is a priority, for which I am pursuing Scrum Master and Professional Agile Leadership certifications from Scrum.org. To further cement my technical abilities, I aim to obtain certifications in Docker, Node.js, and ReactJS from reputable institutions. These certifications will not only validate my skills but also open new avenues for professional growth in the ever-evolving tech landscape.
